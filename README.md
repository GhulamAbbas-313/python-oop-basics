# python-oop-basics
This repository has my small Python projects that I made while learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Each folder in this repo is a separate project that helps me understand OOP step by step.

## 📘 What I Learned Here
- What are Classes and Objects  
- How Constructors (`__init__`) work  
- Instance and Class variables  
- Methods and simple logic building  
- More projects will be added soon (like Bank, Library, etc.)

## 📁 Projects
1. [Student Class Project](./student-class) — My first OOP project in Python.
